    "Epidemiological parameters are a necessity in understanding the spread of infectious disease; from the rate of transmission, to severity, to serology, these parameters underline our ability to quantify and respond to disease outbreaks. The estimation of epidemiological parameters has a long history in epidemiology and the models and methods applied have become more complex; and with this complexity comes the numerous ways parameters can be reported in the literature. Here we provide guidance on how to clearly communicate estimated epidemiological parameters, to maximise their secondary use and minimise possible human errors that come with extracting parameters from the literature and applying them in their own epidemiological analysis. Our aim is for future work that reports epidemiological parameters to be consistent, reproducible and comparable."
