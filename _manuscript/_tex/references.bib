Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens.

Prior to the ongoing outbreak, Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused relatively small outbreaks (maximum outbreak size 425 in Gulu, Uganda) in isolated populations in central Africa. Here, we have compiled a comprehensive database of estimates of epidemiological parameters based on data from past outbreaks, including the incubation period distribution, case fatality rate, basic reproduction number (R0), effective reproduction number (Rt) and delay distributions. We have compared these to parameter estimates from the ongoing outbreak in West Africa. The ongoing outbreak, because of its size, provides a unique opportunity to better understand transmission patterns of EVD. We have not performed a meta-analysis of the data, but rather summarize the estimates by virus from comprehensive investigations of EVD and Marburg outbreaks over the past 40 years. These estimates can be used to parameterize transmission models to improve understanding of initial spread of EVD outbreaks and to inform surveillance and control guidelines.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever, caused by Lassa virus (LASV), poses a significant public health threat in West Africa. Understanding the epidemiological parameters and transmission dynamics of LASV is crucial for informing evidence-based interventions and outbreak response strategies.
Methods We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42023393345) to compile and analyse key epidemiological parameters, mathematical models, and past outbreaks of LASV. Data were double extracted from published literature, focusing on past outbreaks, seroprevalence, transmissibility, epidemiological delays, and disease severity.
Findings We found 157 publications meeting our inclusion criteria and extracted 374 relevant parameter estimates. Although LASV is endemic in West Africa, spatiotemporal coverage of recent seroprevalence estimates, ranging from 0.06\% to 35\%, was poor. Highlighting the uncertainty in LASV risk spatially. Similarly, only two basic reproduction number estimates at 1.13 and 1.19 were available. We estimated a pooled total random effect case fatality ratio of 33.1\% (95\% CI: 25.7 – 41.5, I2 = 94\%) and found potential variation in severity by geographic regions typically associated with specific LASV lineages. We estimated a pooled total random effect mean symptom-onset-to-hospital-admission delay of 8.3 days (95\% CI: 7.4 – 9.3, I2 = 92\%), but other epidemiological delays were poorly characterised.
Interpretation Our findings highlight the relative lack of empirical LASV parameter estimates despite its high severity. Improved surveillance to capture mild cases and approaches that integrate rodent populations are needed to better understand LASV transmission dynamics. Addressing these gaps is essential for developing accurate mathematical models and informing evidence-based interventions to mitigate the impact of Lassa fever on public health in endemic regions.

Evidence before this study We searched PubMed up to August 2, 2023 for ((lassa fever) or (lassa virus)) and (epidemiology or outbreak or (models not image) or transmissibility or severity or delays or (risk factors) or (mutation rate) or seroprevalence). We found ten systematic reviews. Three on ribavirin as a Lassa fever treatment, two on Lassa virus (LASV) vaccine candidates, and one each on historical importations of Lassa fever cases from West Africa to non-endemic countries, clinical characteristics for protocol development, and Lassa fever in pregnancy. Two systematically reviewed epidemiological parameters. One on basic reproduction number estimates which ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 for human-to-human and 1.5 to 1.7 for rodent-to-rodent transmission. However, no meta-analyses were conducted. The other focused on LASV infection case fatality ratios (CFRs): 29.7\% (22.3–37.5) in humans and prevalence: 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8– 10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. There were no systematic reviews on LASV transmission models.Added value of this study We provide a comprehensive overview of published outbreaks, transmission models and epidemiological parameters for LASV. We highlight the sparsity of key epidemiological parameter estimates such as the serial interval or generation time. The discrepancy between the high overall severity and the high seroprevalence in the general population suggests a high proportion of infections are asymptomatic or only result in mild disease. Therefore, current surveillance systems may need refining to better characterise LASV transmission dynamics.Implications of all the available evidence Epidemiological models are useful tools for real-time analysis of outbreaks, assessing epidemic trajectories and the impact of interventions. Our study is a useful basis to inform future LASV models, but highlights uncertainties and knowledge gaps that need to be filled in LASV transmission and natural history. Future LASV studies will benefit from integrating human and rodent reservoir surveillance.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08841v1},
	abstract = {Epidemiological delays, such as incubation periods, serial intervals, and hospital lengths of stay, are among key quantities in infectious disease epidemiology that inform public health policy and clinical practice. This information is used to inform mathematical and statistical models, which in turn can inform control strategies. There are three main challenges that make delay distributions difficult to estimate. First, the data are commonly censored (e.g., symptom onset may only be reported by date instead of the exact time of day). Second, delays are often right truncated when being estimated in real time (not all events that have occurred have been observed yet). Third, during a rapidly growing or declining outbreak, overrepresentation or underrepresentation, respectively, of recently infected cases in the data can lead to bias in estimates. Studies that estimate delays rarely address all these factors and sometimes report several estimates using different combinations of adjustments, which can lead to conflicting answers and confusion about which estimates are most accurate. In this work, we formulate a checklist of best practices for estimating and reporting epidemiological delays with a focus on the incubation period and serial interval. We also propose strategies for handling common biases and identify areas where more work is needed. Our recommendations can help improve the robustness and utility of reported estimates and provide guidance for the evaluation of estimates for downstream use in transmission models or other analyses.},

	abstract = {Understanding and accurately estimating epidemiological delay distributions is important for public health policy. These estimates directly influence epidemic situational awareness, control strategies, and resource allocation. In this study, we explore challenges in estimating these distributions, including truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases. Despite their importance, these issues are frequently overlooked in the current literature, often resulting in biased conclusions. This study aims to shed light on these challenges, providing valuable insights for epidemiologists and infectious disease modellers.
Our work motivates comprehensive approaches for accounting for these issues based on the underlying theoretical concepts. We also discuss simpler methods that are widely used, which do not fully account for known biases. We evaluate the statistical performance of these methods using simulated exponential growth and epidemic scenarios informed by data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic.
Our findings highlight that using simpler methods can lead to biased estimates of vital epidemiological parameters. An approximate-latent-variable method emerges as the best overall performer, while an efficient, widely implemented interval-reduced-censoring-and-truncation method was only slightly worse. Other methods, such as a joint-primary-incidence-and-delay method and a dynamic-correction method, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, although they have inherent limitations and may not be the best choice for more complex problems.
Despite presenting a range of methods that performed well in the contexts we evaluated, residual biases persisted, predominantly due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the censoring interval follows a uniform distribution; instead, this distribution should depend on epidemic dynamics. However, in realistic scenarios with daily censoring, these biases appeared minimal. This study underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions in real-time, provides an overview of the theory that practitioners need to keep in mind when doing so with useful tools to avoid common methodological errors, and points towards areas for future research.
What was known prior to this paperImportance of accurate estimates: Estimating epidemiological delay distributions accurately is critical for model development, epidemic forecasts, and analytic decision support.Right truncation: Right truncation describes the incomplete observation of delays, for which the primary event already occurred but the secondary event has not been observed (e.g. infections that have not yet become symptomatic and therefore not been observed). Failing to account for the right truncation can lead to underestimation of the mean delay during real-time data analysis.Interval censoring: Interval censoring arises when epidemiological events occurring in continuous time are binned into time intervals (e.g., days or weeks). Double censoring of both primary and secondary events needs to be considered when estimating delay distributions from epidemiological data. Accounting for censoring in only one event can lead to additional biases.Dynamical bias: Dynamical biases describe the effects of an epidemic’s current growth or decay rate on the observed delay distributions. Consider an analogy from demography: a growing population will contain an excess of young people, while a shrinking population will contain an excess of older people, compared to what would be expected from mortality profiles alone. Dynamical biases have been identified as significant issues in real-time epidemiological studies.Existing methods: Methods and software to adjust for censoring, truncation, and dynamic biases exist. However, many of these methods have not been systematically compared, validated, or tested outside the context in which they were originally developed. Furthermore, some of these methods do not adjust for the full range of biases.What this paper addsTheory overview: An overview of the theory required to estimate distributions is provided, helping practitioners understand the underlying principles of the methods and the connections between right truncation, dynamical bias, and interval censoring.Review of methods: This paper presents a review of methods accounting for truncation, interval censoring, and dynamical biases in estimating epidemiological delay distributions in the context of the underlying theory.Evaluation of methods: Methods were evaluated using simulations as well as data from the 2014-2016 Sierra Leone Ebola virus disease epidemic.Cautionary guidance: This work underscores the need for caution when estimating epidemiological delay distributions, provides clear signposting for which methods to use when, and points out areas for future research.Practical guidance: Guidance is also provided for those making use of delay distributions in routine practice.Key findingsImpact of neglecting biases: Neglecting truncation and censoring biases can lead to flawed estimates of important epidemiological parameters, especially in real-time epidemic settings.Equivalence of dynamical bias and right truncation: In the context of a growing epidemic, right truncation has an essentially equivalent effect as dynamical bias. Typically, we recommend correcting for one or the other, but not both.Bias in common censoring adjustment: Taking the common approach to censoring adjustment of naively discretising observed delay into daily intervals and fitting continuous-time distributions can result in biased estimates.Performance of methods: We identified an approximate-latent-variable method as the best overall performer, while an interval-reduced-censoring-andtruncation method was resource-efficient, widely implemented, and performed only slightly worse.Inherent limitations of some methods: Other methods, such as jointly estimating primary incidence and the forward delay, and dynamic bias correction, demonstrated good performance under certain conditions, but they also had inherent limitations depending on the setting.Persistence of residual biases: Residual biases persisted across all methods we investigated, largely due to the simplifying assumption that the distribution of event time within the primary censoring interval follows a uniform distribution rather than one influenced by the growth rate. These are minimal if the censoring interval is small compared to other relevant time scales, as is the case for daily censoring with most human diseases.Key limitationsDifferences between right censoring and truncation: We primarily focus on right truncation, which is most relevant when the secondary events are easier to observe than primary events (e.g., symptom onset vs. infection)—in this case, we can’t observe the delay until the secondary event has occurred. In other cases, we can directly observe the primary event and wait for the secondary event to occur (e.g., eventual recovery or death of a hospitalized individual)—in this case, it would be more appropriate to use right censoring to model the unresolved delays. For simplicity, we did not cover the right censoring in this paper.Daily censoring process: Our work considered only a daily interval censoring process for primary and secondary events. To mitigate this, we investigated scenarios with short delays and high growth rates, mimicking longer censoring intervals with extended delays and slower growth rates.Deviation from uniform distribution assumption: We show that the empirical distribution of event times within the primary censoring interval deviated from the common assumption of a uniform distribution due to epidemic dynamics. This discrepancy introduced a small absolute bias based on the length of the primary censoring window to all methods and was a particular issue when delay distributions were short relative to the censoring window’s length. In practice, other biological factors, such as circadian rhythms, are likely to have a stronger effect than the growth rate at a daily resolution. Nonetheless, our work lays out a theoretical ground for linking epidemic dynamics to a censoring process. Further work is needed to develop robust methods for wider censoring intervals.Temporal changes in delay distributions: The Ebola case study showcased considerable variation in reporting delays across the epidemic timeline, far greater than any bias due to censoring or truncation. Further work is needed to extend our methods to address such issues.Lack of other bias consideration: The idealized simulated scenarios we used did not account for observation error for either primary or secondary events, possibly favouring methods that do not account for real-world sources of biases.Limited distributions and methods considered: We only considered lognormal distributions in this study, though our findings are generalizable to other distributions. Mixture distributions and non-parametric or hazard-based methods were not included in our assessment.Exclusion of fitting discrete-time distributions: We focused on fitting continuous-time distributions throughout the paper. However, fitting discretetime distributions can be a viable option in practice, especially at a daily resolution. More work is needed to compare inferences based on discrete-time distributions vs continuous-time distributions with daily censoring.Exclusion of transmission interval distributions: Our work primarily focused on inferring distributions of non-transmission intervals, leaving out potential complications related to dependent events. Additional considerations such as shared source cases, identifying intermediate hosts, and the possibility of multiple source cases for a single infectee were not factored into our analysis.},

	abstract = {Background The case fatality ratio (CFR), the ratio of deaths from an infectious disease to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence. Calculation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases during the course of an epidemic tends to result in a biased CFR. The present study develops a simple method to obtain an unbiased estimate of confirmed CFR (cCFR), using only the confirmed cases as the denominator, at an early stage of epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths. Methodology/Principal Findings Our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. We first examine the approach by analyzing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) with known unbiased cCFR estimate, and then investigate published epidemiological datasets of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the USA and Canada (2009). Because observation of a few deaths alone does not permit estimating the distribution of the time from onset to death, the uncertainty is addressed by means of sensitivity analysis. The maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased cCFR for influenza may lie in the range of 0.16–4.48\% within the assumed parameter space for a factor of underestimation. The estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. Even when there have been no deaths, our model permits estimating a conservative upper bound of the cCFR. Conclusions Although one has to keep in mind that the cCFR for an entire population is vulnerable to its variations among sub-populations and underdiagnosis, our method is useful for assessing virulence at the early stage of an epidemic and for informing policy makers and the public.},

The largest outbreak of Ebola to date is currently underway in West Africa, with 3944 cases reported as of 5th September 2014. To develop a better understanding of Ebola transmission dynamics, we revisited data from the first known Ebola outbreak, which occurred in 1976 in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo). By fitting a mathematical model to time series stratified by disease onset, outcome and source of infection, we were able to estimate several epidemiological quantities that have previously proved challenging to measure, including the contribution of hospital and community infection to transmission. We found evidence that transmission decreased considerably before the closure of the hospital, suggesting that the decline of the outbreak was most likely the result of changes in host behaviour. Our analysis suggests that the person-to-person reproduction number was 1.34 (95\% CI: 0.92–2.11) in the early part of the outbreak. Using stochastic simulations we demonstrate that the same epidemiological conditions that were present in 1976 could have generated a large outbreak purely by chance. At the same time, the relatively high person-to-person basic reproduction number suggests that Ebola would have been difficult to control through hospital-based infection control measures alone.},

The case fatality ratio (CFR: proportion of cases that are fatal) is a key indicator of disease severity useful for gauging the appropriate public health response and for evaluating treatment benefits, if estimated accurately. We analysed individual-level clinical outcome data from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone officially reported to the World Health Organization. The overall mean CFR was 62.9\% (95\% CI: 61.9\% to 64.0\%) among confirmed cases with recorded clinical outcomes. Age was the most important modifier of survival probabilities, but country, stage of the epidemic and whether patients were hospitalized also played roles. We developed a statistical analysis to detect outliers in CFR between districts of residence and treatment centres (TCs), adjusting for known factors influencing survival and identified eight districts and three TCs with a CFR significantly different from the average. From the current dataset, we cannot determine whether the observed variation in CFR seen by district or treatment centre reflects real differences in survival, related to the quality of care or other factors or was caused by differences in reporting practices or case ascertainment.

	abstract = {For epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, and health-care professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches. Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling. Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling Builds from simple to complex predictive models Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLAB In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control},

Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2–14 days with 95\% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3–4 days without truncation and at 5–9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.},

	abstract = {Understanding and monitoring the epidemiological time delay dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights that are key to discerning changes in the phenotype of the virus, the demographics impacted, the efficacy of treatment, and the ability of the health service to manage large volumes of patients. This paper analyses how the pandemic has evolved in the United Kingdom through the temporal changes to the epidemiological time delay distributions for clinical outcomes. Using the most complete clinical data presently available, we have analysed, through a doubly interval censored Bayesian modelling approach, the time from infection to a clinical outcome. Across the pandemic, for the periods that were defined as epidemiologically distinct, the modelled mean ranges from 8.0 to 9.7 days for infection to hospitalisation, 10.3 to 15.0 days for hospitalisation to death, and 17.4 to 24.7 days for infection to death. The time delay from infection to hospitalisation has increased since the first wave of the pandemic. A marked decrease was observed in the time from hospitalisation to death and infection to death at times of high incidence when hospitals and ICUs were under the most pressure. There is a clear relationship between age groups that is indicative of the youngest and oldest demographics having the shortest time delay distributions before a clinical outcome. A statistically significant difference was found between genders for the time delay from infection to hospitalisation, which was not found for hospitalisation to death. The results by age group indicate that younger demographics that require clinical intervention for SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to require earlier hospitalisation that leads to a shorter time to death, which is suggestive of the largely more vulnerable nature of these individuals that succumb to infection. The distinction found between genders for exposure to hospitalisation is revealing of gender healthcare seeking behaviours.},

	abstract = {Estimating the case-fatality risk (CFR)—the probability that a person dies from an infection given that they are a case—is a high priority in epidemiologic investigation of newly emerging infectious diseases and sometimes in new outbreaks of known infectious diseases. The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR—preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays—and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.},

Smoothing spline function was employed to reconstruct the age-specific cumulative incidence of infection. We found that IFR was highest during the first wave, and the second highest during the fourth wave, caused by the Alpha variant. Once vaccination became widespread, IFR decreased considerably among adults aged 40 years plus during the fifth wave caused by the Delta variant, although the epidemic size of fifth wave was the largest before the Omicron variant emerged. We also found that ascertainment bias was relatively high during the first and second waves and, notably, RT-PCR testing capacity during these early periods was limited. Improvements in the ascertainment were seen during the third and fourth waves. Once the Omicron variant began spreading, IFR diminished while ascertainment bias was considerably elevated.},

	abstract = {Following the detection of an infectious disease outbreak, rapid epidemiological assessment is critical for guiding an effective public health response. To understand the transmission dynamics and potential impact of an outbreak, several types of data are necessary. Here we build on experience gained in the West African Ebola epidemic and prior emerging infectious disease outbreaks to set out a checklist of data needed to: (1) quantify severity and transmissibility; (2) characterize heterogeneities in transmission and their determinants; and (3) assess the effectiveness of different interventions. We differentiate data needs into individual-level data (e.g. a detailed list of reported cases), exposure data (e.g. identifying where/how cases may have been infected) and population-level data (e.g. size/demographics of the population(s) affected and when/where interventions were implemented). A remarkable amount of individual-level and exposure data was collected during the West African Ebola epidemic, which allowed the assessment of (1) and (2). However, gaps in population-level data (particularly around which interventions were applied when and where) posed challenges to the assessment of (3). Here we highlight recurrent data issues, give practical suggestions for addressing these issues and discuss priorities for improvements in data collection in future outbreaks.

	abstract = {The timing of transmission plays a key role in the dynamics and controllability of an epidemic. However, observing generation times—the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair—requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals—the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period—the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual—distributions. These two approaches make different—and not always explicitly stated—assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.},

	abstract = {Interval estimates – estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty – have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

	abstract = {Objective
To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs.
Methods
We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n = 28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n = 18). In addition, we adjust for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
Results
Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95\% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
Conclusions
The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.},

	abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the effective reproductive number Rt is important for detecting changes in disease transmission over time. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.},

Unlike other fields of medical research, such as clinical trials and systematic reviews, no reporting guidelines exist for reporting epidemic forecasting and prediction research despite their utility. We therefore developed the EPIFORGE checklist, a guideline for standardized reporting of epidemic forecasting research.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed this checklist using a best-practice process for development of reporting guidelines, involving a Delphi process and broad consultation with an international panel of infectious disease modelers and model end users. The objectives of these guidelines are to improve the consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality of epidemic forecasting reporting. The guidelines are not designed to advise scientists on how to perform epidemic forecasting and prediction research, but rather to serve as a standard for reporting critical methodological details of such studies.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines have been submitted to the EQUATOR network, in addition to hosting by other dedicated webpages to facilitate feedback and journal endorsement.},
