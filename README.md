Repository for the reporting guidance for epidemiological parameters.

Instructions for use:

To add a new use case add a new `.qmd` file to the `use_cases/` folder in the root of the project. The use case can be included in the manuscript using either the `embed` or `include` command in the `index.qmd` file in the project root. [`embed`](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/notebook-embed.html) includes the output from a code block in the manuscript, whereas [`include`]() includes an entire document in the manuscript, this can be useful we including both code and text.


The structure of this repository is based on the https://github.com/quarto-ext/manuscript-template-rstudio template. See https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/rstudio.html for more information.
