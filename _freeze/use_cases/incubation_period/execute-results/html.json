It is critical that the duration of isolation mitigates the risk of onward transmission, but does not extend any longer than necessary due to the costs, both financial and social, associated with isolation.\\\nThe incubation period is most typically presented as a probability distribution, but is often summarised by a mean and estimate of the variability (most commonly standard deviation), rather than the full distribution. \\\nConsider the following example. During a novel Ebola outbreak, the incubation period is estimated using a gamma distribution on just a small number of observations (due to the lack of testing and contact tracing). MCMC methods are used to obtain 100 realisations of a gamma distribution:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# ggplot(samples_longer,\n#        aes(x=value,group=name))+\n#   geom_density(lwd=0.01,col=\"grey\")+\n#   theme_bw()+\n#   labs(x=\"Day\",y=\"Density\",col=\"\")+\n#   xlim(c(0,100))\n\nq95 <- mean(colQuantiles(samples,probs=0.95)) \nl95 <- quantile(colQuantiles(samples,probs=0.95),0.025)\nu95 <- quantile(colQuantiles(samples,probs=0.95),0.975)\n\nggplot(samples_longer,\n       aes(x=value,group=name))+\n  stat_ecdf(geom = \"step\",col=\"grey\")+\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=0.95),linetype=\"dashed\")+ \n  geom_point(aes(x=q95,y=0.95),col=\"blue\",size=3)+\n  geom_linerange(aes(y=0.95,xmin=l95,xmax=u95),col=\"blue\",lwd=1)+\n  theme_bw()+\n  labs(x=\"Day\",y=\"Density\",col=\"\")+\n  xlim(c(0,150))+\n  ylim(c(0,1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_ecdf()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](incubation_period_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis analysis has been repeated several times for this paper, corresponding to different locations and time periods. For sake of space and simplicity, the results per fit are presented in the typical fashion, as noted above: \\\nMean: 12.49 (95% CI 8.52 - 16.64) \\\nSD: 12.92 (95% CI 7.74 - 17.2) \\\nHowever, this omits critical information about the upper 95% quantile of the distribution, which from the figure, is highly variable across realisations. Specifically, this is estimated as: \\\n95% quantile: 37.9 (95% CI 25.7 - 47.8) \\\nwhich has substantial uncertainty. \\\nIn a future outbreak of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the public health authority in the affected country looks to the previous analysis to guide their quarantine policy. Using only the provided information (the mean and SD), it is possible to use method of moments for the gamma distribution to obtain estimates of  the shape and scale parameters (0.93 and 13.62, respectively). Parameterising a gamma distribution according to these parameters corresponds to a 95% quantile of 39 days. This recovers the central estimate above well. However, it is not possible to obtain any uncertainty around this estimate without the authors having provided the full set of samples used to generate these estimates. This may provide a false sense of certainty on which the quarantine policy is based, whereas there may be an argument to either extend or reduce this based on the considerable uncertainty estimated above.\n",
